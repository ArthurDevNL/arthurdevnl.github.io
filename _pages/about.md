Welcome to my personal site. You can find a short description of my background and research interests below. Check out one of my blog posts to know more about what's on my mind.

## Research Interests
In doing my PhD at L3i, La Rochelle Université in collaboration with [Shift Technology](https://www.shift-technology.com/). I'm mostly focused on applying ML to document analysis on administrative documents (invoices, quotes, medical certificates, etc). Specifically, I work on document information extraction and optical character recognition. I approach the problem from a Neuro-Symbolic perspective, where a traditional probabilistic methods (ie neural networks) are combined with symbolic reasoning. The goal is to improve data efficiency, explainability and performance compared to existing, probabilistic-only methods.  

## Background
After a BSc in Computer Science from Utrecht University, The Netherlands, I continued to do an MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics at CentraleSupélec and ESSEC in Paris, France. Following this, I started working as a data scientist at Shift Technology in fraud detection for insurance companies. After three years, I moved to Shift's research team as an ML Research Engineer and started a PhD in collaboration with La Rochelle University on document analysis.

## Other Interests
During and even before my studies, I spent a lot of time doing iOS app development in Objective-C and Swift. In 2013, I was lucky enough to be an Apple WWDC Scholarship recipient. I continue to have an interest and enthusiasm for the Apple ecosystem.
